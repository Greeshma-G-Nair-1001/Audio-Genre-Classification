In the modern music industry, understanding and predicting the popularity of a track and accurately classifying its genre are critical to driving user engagement, improving recommendation systems. Music streaming platforms and artists rely on such insights to tailor playlists, marketing campaigns, and discoverability strategies.

Predict Popularity Scores: Predict the popularity score of an audio track based on features such as tempo, genre, lyrics, key and historical streaming data. Popularity can be measured over a certain period.
